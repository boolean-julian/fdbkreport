0,3,TM1,05.02.20,12:48,,0,21,1,2,4,3,1,4,1,5,3,2,1,being able to rotate with two fingers would aid in a more flexible use; as well as more explicit labeling of the button function.

0,6,MT1,05.02.20,14:22,,1,22,0,2,2,4,1,4,4,3,2,3,2,I think it would be easier to be able to turn the toast by moving it with two fingers instead of holding it with one and moving the camera.
0,2,MT1,05.02.20,12:20,,1,18,0,1,2,3,2,4,1,4,2,2,1,I would prefer if it also gave me feedback an how to certain tasks.
1,4,MT2,05.02.20,14:25,,0,19,1,4,2,3,2,4,1,3,3,3,2,The text / info should get shown longer.
1,1,MT2,05.02.20,12:25,,0,20,1,3,2,2,4,3,3,4,2,2,1,Once I figured out that you can have to  twist the phone; it was a lot easier. So maybe a suggestion that you can twist the phone would be helpful.
0,7,TM1,05.02.20,15:23,,1,28,1,2,3,2,4,4,2,4,4,1,1,Door-open button is hard to see.

1,5,TM0,05.02.20,15:38,no screen for toaster – screens are there,1,23,1,2,3,3,2,4,1,4,2,4,1,Weird that the environment moves and not the toast
1,7,MT1,05.02.20,16:20,,0,26,1,5,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,The app itself is very nice and the idea is very good. However; althrough the controls weren‘t essentially difficult; the way they were presented to someone that is not familiar with the features can be quite tricky. In my opinion; they could be more intuitive out of these details; great job!
2,5,TM0,05.02.20,16:16,,0,22,1,3,2,4,2,3,2,5,3,4,1,Some text tips should be useful to get the ?algorithm? Of the particular AR app
2,4,MT1,05.02.20,16:05,,1,23,0,5,1,5,1,5,1,5,1,5,1,It would be nice; if the app could recover from the user accidentally moving their hand in front of the camera (maybe generate an old state)
0,8,MT0,05.02.20,16:05,,0,26,1,1,2,4,1,4,2,5,3,3,1,After a couple of misstries it would be nice to get a hint how to tilt the phone.

2,9,TM0,21.02.20,19:03,,1,28,1,3,2,2,1,4,1,5,2,4,1,Short notice how to use things in the app if someone is not able to use them properly.

2,13,MT3,02.03.20,14:07,,0,23,1,4,4,3,1,5,1,4,2,2,1,Rotating the phone to rotate objects is very counterintuitive.
2,14,TM3,02.03.20,14:15,,0,22,0,4,1,4,1,5,1,5,2,4,1,I did not know how to rotate objects so hints were really helpful
2,15,TM3,03.03.20,11:17,,1,26,0,3,4,3,2,4,1,3,3,4,2,remove unnecessary complexities (Toast turning for example)
2,16,MT3,03.03.20,18:47,,0,29,0,4,2,4,1,4,1,4,2,4,1,Integrate giving tasks in application; insert hints more central at the bottom; be consistent in object approach – either by movement of the phone or touchpad intuition.
1,8,MT2,22.02.20,17:07:00,,0,28,0,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,2,4,4,"Sometimes the objects were moving, especially in mid-air beside the table."
1,9,MT2,22.02.20,17:14:52,,0,27,1,2,2,4,1,4,1,5,1,5,1,Implementing rotation of objects with 2 fingers would be better.
