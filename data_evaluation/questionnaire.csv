0,3,2,TM1,05.02.20,12:48,,0,21,1,2,4,3,1,4,1,5,3,2,1,,1,1,,being able to rotate with two fingers would aid in a more flexible use; as well as more explicit labeling of the button function.

0,6,1,MT1,05.02.20,14:22,,1,22,0,2,2,4,1,4,4,3,2,3,2,,1,,,I think it would be easier to be able to turn the toast by moving it with two fingers instead of holding it with one and moving the camera.
0,2,1,MT1,05.02.20,12:20,,1,18,0,1,2,3,2,4,1,4,2,2,1,1,,,,I would prefer if it also gave me feedback an how to certain tasks.
1,4,0,MT2,05.02.20,14:25,,0,19,1,4,2,3,2,4,1,3,3,3,2,1,,,,The text / info should get shown longer.
1,1,2,MT2,05.02.20,12:25,,0,20,1,3,2,2,4,3,3,4,2,2,1,,1,,,Once I figured out that you can have to  twist the phone; it was a lot easier. So maybe a suggestion that you can twist the phone would be helpful.

1,5,0,TM0,05.02.20,15:38,no screen for toaster – screens are there,1,23,1,2,3,3,2,4,1,4,2,4,1,,1,,,Weird that the environment moves and not the toast
1,7,2,MT1,05.02.20,16:20,,0,26,1,5,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,,1,,,The app itself is very nice and the idea is very good. However; althrough the controls weren‘t essentially difficult; the way they were presented to someone that is not familiar with the features can be quite tricky. In my opinion; they could be more intuitive out of these details; great job!
2,5,0,TM0,05.02.20,16:16,,0,22,1,3,2,4,2,3,2,5,3,4,1,1,,,,Some text tips should be useful to get the ?algorithm? Of the particular AR app
2,4,2,MT1,05.02.20,16:05,,1,23,0,5,1,5,1,5,1,5,1,5,1,,,,1,It would be nice; if the app could recover from the user accidentally moving their hand in front of the camera (maybe generate an old state)
0,8,1,MT0,05.02.20,16:05,,0,26,1,1,2,4,1,4,2,5,3,3,1,1,1,,,After a couple of misstries it would be nice to get a hint how to tilt the phone.

2,13,1,MT3,02.03.20,14:07,,0,23,1,4,4,3,1,5,1,4,2,2,1,,1,,,Rotating the phone to rotate objects is very counterintuitive.

2,15,0,TM3,03.03.20,11:17,,1,26,0,3,4,3,2,4,1,3,3,4,2,,1,,,remove unnecessary complexities (Toast turning for example)
