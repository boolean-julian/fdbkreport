- pinch zoom not fully evaluated
	- initially the approach concentrated on pinch zoom and two finger rotations as incorrect usages.
	- pinch zoom didn't appear often with our given case study setup
		- numbers compared to numbers of tfr
		* reasons for not appearance (rather big controls, start directly in front of the device)
		* assumption: could be more useful for other applications and evaluations from the tfr should work the same for pz.

- task t2 most evaluated bc it was the first appearance of the toast rotation, which triggered the tfr incorrect usage.
	- 2 different measures are used (time to fulfill the task and # of tfrs)
		- 0 tries not taken into account, bc users didn't received feedback msg
		* some users can do it intuitively (but only 3 of 40)
			* for most users a helpful feedback would be good
		* imp3 seems to have a positive effect on the efficiency of users
			* visible in time and tfr tries
				* tfr even show a significant change (ref on welch t-test) 
			* (Effect Size)

- sus evaluation: total scores
	* no correlation to other results, no big diffs between the groups
	* seems like users feeling on usability depends on other factors. (prototype design usability, general criticism)

- open questions
	* evaluate what user feedback appeared
	* take some details on user feedback (what can be taken from it? What fits to the other results?)


tags for open question: feedback/help, control, prototype 

* why do pinch zooms not appear often?
* why is t2 most demanding?
* why does tfr appear often?
* explaination of huge std
* pinch zoom in t2 came bc users tried everything to solve
* low number of users without incorrect usage
* result: 3 is best why? why aren't the others?
* open question answers not directed to the question
