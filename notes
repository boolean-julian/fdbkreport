NOTES [09.03.2020]
==================

Introduction:
* Why is the problem we solve an actual problem? Cite!
* The AR applications we talk about are *MOBILE* AR messages, state that!
* "better in comparison to other types" -> "the best" because that is our research goal
* For *THE* validation ...
(* Should be revised later)

Foundations:
* graphics:
	* one phone with one prototype and one feedback message
	* OR like before, but everything needs to be on the pics:
		* all feedback message types in response to one gesture (i.e. pinch zoom) for all prototypes, i.e.
			* toaster front view type 1 "pinch zoom"
			* toaster rear view type 2 "pinch zoom"
			* microwave front view type 3 "pinch zoom"


* "it shall be clarified" is passive -> active
* again, *MOBILE* AR
(* it may not be required to put unity3d and blender)
* vivian: describe more thoroughly
	* mobile AR
	* virtual prototype
	* what kind of interaction
	* explain the concept of one finger inputs in vivian
	* a small example (microwave, toaster, ...)

* SUS: what is usability? be clear about the methodology

Approach:
* Put "how to use" stuff into foundations
* graphics: different feedback styles
* not him/his/he -> THEY
* describe table 1, remove place holders!
* clarify end of the section


	for now:
	* limiting -> restrictive
	* supportive, limiting -> supportive
	* supportive, concise -> concise

	rather:
	* critique
	* combined
	* support

Case Study Setup:
* remove "as you can see"s etc
* describe how the case study *works*
	* we introduce the participant
	* participant does this, then this, then this ...

* after that: how many participants, ... (what we already have)
