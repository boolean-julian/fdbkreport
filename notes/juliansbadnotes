what to change:

table:
* mann whitney u test significance and effect sizes for whatever is significant
	which is
		m3 1 time -> longer
		t3 2 time -> shorter 
		t2 3 time -> shorter
		t2 3 tfr -> less
		t2 3 pinch -> less (actually zero)

results:
* change: talking about pinch zoom not appearing often *enough for it to matter* (leave in stars away)
* add: what did we evaluate
* add: report every significant effect and its size (significance, effsize, ...)
* change: everything with mann whitney U instead of tests that require normal distr

discussion:
	about pinch zoom:
	* pinch zoom didn't appear a lot, where it did it doesn't matter, because...
		-> 	no other metrics back the fact up that something we did had an actual effect on pinch 		zooming behavior
	* we can't disprove that there is something to be found tho
	* people just pinch zoom when they try doing shit in control (they try every freaking gesture)

	m3:
	* (almost) no appearences of wrong gestures
		(3 pz, 0 tfr among 10 participants in g1) (0 pz, 0 tfr among 10 participants in g0)
		-> it's crap
